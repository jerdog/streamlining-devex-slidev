To run the slides with a rabbit timer, append `?time=xx` to the URL, where `xx` is the number of minutes you want the timer to run for.

## Abstract

In this talk, we delve into the core aspects of CI/CD which can significantly impact Developer Experience: Pipeline Standardization and Interoperability. We'll explore the pivotal role of standardized practices in CI/CD pipelines, fostering consistency and reducing friction in the development lifecycle. We will also look at how well-defined pipeline architecture and standardized configurations, can empower developers with a smoother and more efficient workflow.

We will also discuss the critical importance of interoperability in CI/CD systems. Enabling seamless collaboration across the diverse toolsets and environments that exist today is a core advantage of interoperability. This enhancing flexibility, and allows teams to leverage their preferred tools without compromising the overall development pipeline.
